considerations
- if there are words that are both verbs and nouns (for example)
	- should have two separate counters for them

check if capitalized first and then probably pronoun?

past tense
- if ends with e, just add 'd' not 'ed'
- if two words
	- just past tense the first

don't do numbers

dont do more or most

pluralize
- if y, go to 'ies'

pluralize and/or 3rd person present
- if 'ch' or 'ss', add 'es' not 's'

dont do not

be is weird...


non standards
- send -> sent
etc
