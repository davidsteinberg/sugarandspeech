words you have repeated again and again
- recommend additional vocab for those

word count
- words with more than 1 or 2

can check:
- number of repeats of word
- proximity of words
	- how far apart should they be?

considerations
- if there are words that are both verbs and nouns (for example)
	- should have two separate counters for them
